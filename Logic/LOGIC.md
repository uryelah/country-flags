This is a logic test.

Given the following 2d matrix (this is a sample input, you should consider alternative inputs):

```
[[1,1,1,1],
[0,1,1,0],
[0,1,0,1],
[0,1,9,1],
[1,1,1,1]]
```

Create a virtual robot, that can walk up, right, left and bottom. The robot cannot leave the borders.

Find the shortest path to `9`. `1` is a walkable place. `0` is a hole, and you must avoid it.

Your initial position is `0x0`, the `9` position is `2x3`.

Good luck!
